Hello guys this is the flask mvc project structure we are going to be using. 

## First initialization 
 > To initialize the project firstly you have to create a virtual environment by running the following commands in your terminal

    python -m venv 

> And then activate your environment with 

    source directory-to-your-environment/Scripts/activate 

> Afterwards run pip install to install libraries 

    pip install -r requirements.txt


There after you can just run the app.py file to check if everything is working smoothly
